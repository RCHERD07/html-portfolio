<h1>The Best Movies According to Richard</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
    This is probably my most favorite. I can remember watching <br/>
    this movie so many times growing up and I love that Andy <br/>
    finally got his freedom.

<h3>Matrix Trilogy</h3>
<p>I just love Scifi!</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>They should have never messed with his dog.</p>
